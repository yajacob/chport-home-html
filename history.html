          A Brief History of the church in Portland</p>
            <p><span class="churchinportland">In 1970 two couples  living in Portland</span> &nbsp;began to fellowship together seeking deeper experiences of  Christ. Through the book: &quot;The All Inclusive Christ&quot; their hearts  were warmed and their hunger for more of the riches of Christ grew in them. One  of the couples had&nbsp;attended some meetings with the church in  Seattle&nbsp;and suggested they drive up together one Lord's day to join them  for a meeting. The first meeting they attended produced such a&nbsp;desire in them&nbsp;that&nbsp;drew  these couples back again and again. The trips up and down Interstate 5 gave  them much time to pray, fellowship and to&nbsp;enjoy the Lord together. They  discovered the riches of Christ through the ministry of Watchman Nee and  Witness Lee and the tremendous benefit of meeting with the church in Seattle.  During one of the meetings in Seattle a brother asked all those from Portland  to stand up. To the surprise of these two couples a third couple stood up as  well. The third couple had grown up in one of the churches in Taiwan and was  working in Portland on a cancer research study. Now there were three  couples&nbsp;gathering in Portland during the week and traveling to Seattle on  most week ends.</p>
            <p><span class="churchinportland">In 1971 through much  fellowship between these&nbsp;couples</span>, the church in Seattle, and the church in  Los Angeles many&nbsp;families picked up a burden from the Lord to migrate to  Portland to strengthen what the Lord was doing there. Several families moved to  Portland from Seattle and from Los Angeles during the summer of 1971.&nbsp;One caravan  form Los Angeles came with three U-Haul trucks and four automobiles and landed  at one of these couples homes. That home became the meeting place of the church  in Portland in those early days&nbsp;of 1971. The church in Portland had a  glorious beginning with saints coming together&nbsp;to blend from three  major&nbsp;cities as the testimony of Jesus&nbsp;for the building up of the  Body of Christ. From 1971 through the summer of 1974 the church in Portland  grew day by day in the divine life and increased in number as the brothers and  sisters remained steadfast in the teaching and the fellowship&nbsp;of the  apostles. The enjoyment of the Lord was rich and the growth in the divine life  was steady. The golden lampstand in Portland was shining brightly.</p>
            <p><span class="churchinportland">During the summer of  1974</span> through fellowship the majority of the saints meeting as the church in  Portland were led to move to strengthen other churches in a consolidated way. A  few families remained in Portland including one of the original couples from  1970. The next couple of years were trying for the saints remaining in  Portland. The Lord heard the prayers of these faithful saints and in 1976 He  began to&nbsp;draw other local Christians.&nbsp;In February of 1976  three&nbsp;seeking college students from George Fox College, who had previously  been to some meetings with the church in Seattle, were brought into contact  with the remaining saints in Portland.&nbsp;Around the same time&nbsp;two  couples from Milwaukie, Oregon&nbsp;and a single mom joined with these brothers  and sisters to begin a regular home meeting on Tuesday evenings. They often  traveled to Seattle and at times to Roseburg to meet with churches in those  cities. In March of 1976 the church in Seattle with the church in Roseburg  rented a campsite in Colton (near Portland) named&nbsp;Camp Adams and held  meetings there on a Friday evening and&nbsp;Saturday. The brothers and sisters  enjoyed sharingâ€™s on calling on the name of the Lord, enjoying the Lord's  presence and the ground of the church. By the end of that&nbsp;week end eight  more began to meet with these saints in Portland. Even though some of the  brothers and sisters gathering in Portland moved that summer to other  localities,&nbsp;others were compelled by the Lord to remain in Portland and  these saints began again to meet as the church in Portland&nbsp;during the  summer of 1976. The saints in Portland through&nbsp;continuing steadfastly in  the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles grew in life and&nbsp;in  numbers over the next many years.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span class="churchinportland">Through  much&nbsp;fellowship in 1980</span> some&nbsp;families from both Eugene and Corvallis  migrated to Portland to strengthen the Lord's testimony there. The  church&nbsp;continued to have&nbsp;a steady growth in life and building. We  attribute the steady growth in life and building to the local saints steadfast  stand with the one unique&nbsp;ministry of God's New Testament economy and  their endeavoring to live in the reality of the Body of Christ. Our love for  the Lord and our love and care for His Body increases day by day. Our present  hope and consecration is to&nbsp;hold on to what we have&nbsp;with the little  strength the Lord has given us.&nbsp;We are simple brothers who are learning to  abandon everything other than Christ and His glorious Church. It is our  practice to have annual conferences in Portland or in a nearby locality,  meeting with&nbsp;brothers and sisters from Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Bend,  Eugene, Roseburg and Medford. We&nbsp;invite the&nbsp;blended brothers to  come&nbsp;and share with us&nbsp;for&nbsp;our annual conferences.&nbsp;About  once a month, brothers from these seven localities meet for prayer, fellowship  and blending together. All the churches in Oregon enjoy the blessing of Life  that is poured out on the one Body of Christ. We continue to travel to meet  also with the many other churches in the northwest, including&nbsp;gathering  about twice a year with&nbsp;the leading brothers from all the northwest  churches. Through much visiting and blending the church in Portland is healthy  and rescued from being independent. We really need all the churches to express  His Body on earth.</p>
          <p><span class="churchinportland">The Lord&nbsp;blessed  the church in Portland in 2008</span> with a team of brothers and sisters serving  full-time with the entire church as a net for the fruit bearing, nourishing and  mutual&nbsp;perfecting of one another for the building up of His Body. The  church in Portland's&nbsp;labor is day by day and&nbsp;from house to house. We  gather all together on the Lord's Day&nbsp;to enjoy the Lord's table and for  all the saints to&nbsp;prophesy&nbsp;for&nbsp;the building up of the church. We  also&nbsp;gather&nbsp;together weekly in&nbsp;prayer meetings to stand together  with the Lord in His heavenly ministry to bind His enemy and to loose God's  interest on this earth. What a church life we enjoy. We invite you to come and  enjoy the splendid church life with us. &quot;To Him be the glory in the  church&nbsp;and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever.  Amen&quot; (Ephesians 3:21)&nbsp;</p>            </td>
