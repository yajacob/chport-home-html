          Growing Up<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2"><strong>H</strong>aving  grown up in a Christian home and passed through a Christian-based education, I  was surrounded by the Word of God from a very young age. I remember singing  scripture songs as a young child and reading the Psalms out loud to myself just  to hear the poetry. Throughout my childhood and both junior and senior high  school I responded well to memorization and Bible-reading challenges in the  youth group and Bible camps of the local church in Portland, Oregon, where I  grew up. By the time I graduated from high school I had read the New Testament  at least three times through. However, as I entered college, somehow, whether  it was the increased workload or just other pursuits, my Bible reading waned. I  loved the Lord. I desired to know His will for my life, but I couldn't say that  I truly loved His Word. Throughout the course of my days I would talk to the  Lord, bringing to Him my problems, inviting Him into my studies, and seeking  His guidance regarding human relationships, but more often than not I would  become very frustrated because I couldn't hear Him speak back to me. I couldn't  understand why just asking Him wasn't enough for me to hear His speaking.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>A</strong>s a transfer student to The University  of Texas I found the answer to my frustration. While meeting with the local  church in Austin I opened my situation to a dear sister who served with the  college students there. She shared with me that the Word of God is the Lord's  speaking to us. Through her fellowship I realized that though I was speaking to  the Lord, I wasn't listening to Him. Because I hadn't been in His Word, I  wasn't giving Him the way to speak to me. She encouraged me to get a  pocket-sized Bible and begin to read it on the bus, in between classes, and  whenever I could find the chance. The point was to let the Word saturate my  mind and thoughts. As I read I would often stop to pray over what I was  reading, mingling the word with my prayer (Ephesians 6:17-18). With this  renewed supply of the Word being implanted in my heart and mind, I began to be  refreshed by the Lord's speaking throughout my days.<br />
              <br />
            <strong>C</strong>urrently in the Full-Time Training in  Anaheim, California my love for the Lord and His Word is increasing as I  discover through the ministry of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee the hidden truths  in the Word. Here I am being trained to spend time in His Word daily, to allow  it to dwell in me richly (Colossians 3:16). As the Word begins to saturate and  permeate my thoughts, I cannot help but hear the Lord's speaking in my life. I  love the Word of God!</p>
