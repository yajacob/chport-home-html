          My Name is Noah<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2"><strong>M</strong>y name is  Noah Salvione and I would like to testify how much I love the Lord and how  thankful I am that He brought me to experience the real, daily, practical  church. I owe my whole life to Him. I was blessed by the Lord to be born of two  Christian parents who had already seen a vision of the Body of Christ.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>I </strong>grew up  in a very sweet, loving, and caring family life that was a result of my  parents' love for and experience of Christ. Every time I consider family  situations these days, I really thank the Lord for bringing me up in a family  that was full of love for each other and love for the Lord. I appreciate the  Lord's arrangement and care more and more each day.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>A</strong>s I grew  older my heart towards the Lord grew cold. Eventually by my freshman year of  college I had grown away from the Lord and my relationship with my family was  somewhat strained. I still believed in God, but I just didn't feel like I  needed Him. Through some circumstances I ended up visiting a Christian training  in Southern California with my older brother in the summer of 1995. It was at  that training that I fell in love with the Lord again and realized that the  church was His deep longing and would one day be His bride. I am full of  appreciation to the Lord for showing Himself and His heart's desire to me. It  was a spontaneous and natural reaction to pursue Him.<br />
              <br />
            <strong>U</strong>pon my return home I began to met with  the church in Portland and attend more meetings. At first it was the Lord  Himself that attracted me and drew me, but eventually I began to realize that I  am just a fragile and weak man. At that time the dear Christians in the local  church really kept me going. Many times I have been distracted from the Lord,  but the brothers and sisters in Portland were always there for me. I realized  that I will not and cannot make it on my own. I appreciate the Lord unveiling a  vision of His church to me. It is a wonder and a joy to be brought into the  church, Christ's deep longing, and it is a privilege and a honor to work with  Him to prepare His bride.</p>
