          A 4th Generation Christian<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2"><strong>I </strong>grew up  meeting with the local church in Portland, Oregon. As far as I know, I am a  fourth-generation Christian. One of my great-grandfathers turned to the Lord in  China during the late 1800s. He was very much persecuted for his belief, and  many of his relatives were martyred during the Boxer Rebellion. My grandfather  also believed into Christ in China during his college years. During that time  he was helped by the ministry of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee and was meeting  with the local churches in China.<br />
              <strong>W</strong>hen he  came to the United States, he brought up my parents to meet with the local  church, who in turn brought up my brothers and me in the same way. At first,  meeting with the church was a duty, something I had to do because my parents  and grandparents did it. The local church was just another part of my life,  just as school and music were. But despite my lack of appreciation for the  local church, it played a big part in my childhood. Meeting with the church  during childhood was a big factor in preserving me from the worldly  distractions that I encountered while growing up. Because I was under the care  of other brothers and sisters and was receiving the sanctifying Word through  them, I had an awareness that I was separated to the Lord. I was not so free to  do all the things unbelievers were doing, and if I did them, I always felt a  little uneasy. This was how I began to know the Lord and His inward speaking.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>W</strong>hen I  went away to Seattle for college, I continued meeting with the local church in  Seattle. It was at this time that my life changed from one of passive duty to  the Lord to one of aggressive pursuit of Him. I moved into a house with several  other brothers who met with the local church who were pursuing the Lord in a  strong way. Living in such an environment, my hunger for the Lord was  immediately stirred up. And with the brothers, there was no lack of supply to  fill that hunger. I began to read more books by Watchman Nee and Witness Lee,  which opened my eyes to see the truths in God's Word and the principles of the  Christian life. I also began to grow more in the Lord through healthy habits of  contacting the Lord in the morning, regularly reading the Bible, and even  speaking the gospel to others. In addition, I began receiving much light and  enjoyment through meeting with the other brothers and sisters attending the  local church's meetings.<br />
              <br />
              Even if I had a discouraging day, going  to the meetings never failed to bring in new life and encouragement. It was at  that time that I began to enjoy the daily Christian life.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>E</strong>ver since  I tasted the enjoyment of such a life, the taste has never left. Meeting with  the brothers and sisters continues to be a source of supply and enjoyment.<br />
              <strong>A</strong>s one hymn states:<br />
            </p>
            <p class="style2"><strong>W</strong>e have found that meeting with the  saints<br />
              <strong>I</strong>s the greatest joy on earth;<br />
              'Tis  by this our spirit never faints<br />
              <strong>A</strong>nd our lives are filled with worth.</p>
