          A Deep Hunger<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2">I  was saved in a Christian home when I was six years old and met with my family  in the Baptist church until the time that I was a senior in high  school.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was happy to be with my friends in the church but didn’t  find the strength that I needed to pursue the Lord once I left for  college.&nbsp; After high school, and in college I stopped going to church and  pursued my own interests.&nbsp; I was not interested in going to church on  Sunday or joining church groups but by the Lord’s mercy I was fortunate to have  many Christian friends and was kept from harming myself.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              After  years of not being satisfied, the Lord led me to read my Bible again and to  need a place where I could meet with other Christians.&nbsp; I went back to  meeting with the Baptist church, but the feelings of what caused me to leave in  the first place began to creep in and a deeper thirst caused me to share my  experience with a close friend.&nbsp; In a phone call with my friend I shared  that I was seeking the Lord.&nbsp; He shared with me that I needed to tell his  father.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
              I  went to my friend’s house where I had gone many times before and began to share  my experience with his father.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I shared that I wanted to  “Pursue Christ”, his only response was&nbsp; “Ok, why don’t you come to a  meeting with me tomorrow night.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 
              &nbsp;<br />
            It  was in this meeting that I met a group of believers who enjoyed the Lord in a  simple, genuine, and real way.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was through the reading of the  ministry of a Christian brother, Witness Lee, that brought me into a clear view  of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was what I was looking  for.&nbsp; This was what satisfied my longing deep  within.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
