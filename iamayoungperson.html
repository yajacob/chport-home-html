          I Am a Young Person<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2"><strong>I </strong>am a young person who grew up loving  the Lord, learning about Him, and experiencing Him in a daily way in the local  church. My parents were Christians, and they showed my two sisters and I how to  be pursuers of Christ. They read the Bible and prayed with us. We had meetings  in our home and sang enjoyable songs about the Lord Jesus. Most importantly,  they helped us love God. I grew up with the knowledge that God loved me, but I  also knew I was a sinner. Among other things, I lied, hated and stole. When I was  eight years old, I called on the Lord's name and asked Him to save me. I'm  nobody. I don't deserve God, but He still loves me. Ever since He saved me, He  has been in my heart drawing me to seek Him and to love Him more. I passed  through a troublesome time in junior high and high school, but somehow the Lord  preserved my heart for Him. In college, I spent a lot of time with other  believers and I went to many Christian retreats. I met many other young people  from different places. We always got revived and encouraged in the Lord. At  those times, I would always give my life again to the Lord and have a new  beginning with Him. I now see how throughout those years God really took care  of me and my family. Today, by the Lord's mercy, I am still loving Him and pursuing  Him. He is my goal, my joy, and my everything. It was here in the local church  that I fell in love with the Lord Jesus Christ. I also have to say I love the  believers, the Body of Christ. All the young people I grew up with and all the  older brothers and sisters are my family. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.  I am so happy and satisfied with Christ in the local church.<br />
              <strong>G</strong>od's Desire<br />
              <br />
            <strong>I </strong>thank and praise the Lord for the  ministry of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. As a young person, I had the great privilege  of hearing Witness Lee speak in about ten Bible trainings and many conferences  throughout the United States. My first time to hear him was in Seattle. I was  in junior high school. I wasn't that interested in what he said then, but his  heart for the Lord and for all of the saints impressed me. As I got into high  school and college I started to see, through his speaking, that God has an  eternal purpose. He has a heart's desire and an arrangement to carry it out.  God wants to be one with man. He created man, but man fell. Then God had to do  something to redeem man. Becoming a man, God went through incarnation, human  living, death, burial, resurrection and ascension. But why did God do this? God  became a man to make man one with Him in life and nature but not in the  Godhead. God loves man and wants to be one with him. He wants an eternal  expression of Himself on this earth. Today, His bride is being prepared. Each  day I am being saved much more in His life until eventually even my body will  be glorified. I just have to cooperate with the Lord and let Him transform me  day by day. Watchman Nee and Witness Lee's ministry has opened up the Bible so  that I can see God's eternal purpose clearly. But most importantly, they have  caused me to love and pursue the Lord more. Without love, all my Bible  knowledge is vain. I've seen that the Bible is a romance between God and man.  Everyday I want to fall in love again with Christ so that He can gain His Bride  and be satisfied.</p>
