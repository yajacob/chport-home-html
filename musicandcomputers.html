          Music &amp; Computers Were My Life<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2"><strong>I </strong>grew up  in a family that met with the church in Portland, attended Beaverton High  School, and played viola and violin in the Portland Youth Philharmonic.  Throughout high school, music and computers were my life. My time was spent  between school, music lessons, playing computer games, and studying. Church was  something I went to on Sundays and periodically enjoyed on Friday nights. Other  than these two times, I knew nothing of the Lord Jesus, and practically never  experienced Him in my life as I do now.<br />
              <strong>I</strong>n my  senior year of high school, I applied to an aggressive double major program at  Columbia University and The Julliard School, the most prestigious music school  in the world. I was accepted into the undergraduate program at both schools,  and began an intensive three-year pursuit of a bachelor's degree in computer  science, while at the same time taking lessons from a teacher at Julliard.  Those three years were the most stressful years in my life, and also the most  lonely. My time was devoted to studying, typing out computer programs in my  room, or practicing etudes and sonatas in a practice room. Outside of my  academic pursuits in the heart of New York City, the only other object that  held my interest was meeting with the local church in New York City. Every  weekend, I had the opportunity to get away from the stress of school and stay  with a family from the church. They offered me home-cooked meals, a comfortable  bed, a warm environment, and soul-restoring fellowship. I can testify that  those weekends became a source of supply to me throughout my college years,  and, through my contact with Christian brothers and sisters, the Lord became  more real to me than ever before. In three years of school, I attended more  meetings of the church than ever before. Each meeting was a blessing to me, and  I never came away from a meeting unsatisfied. I also was involved with teaching  the tenth grade Sunday school class. Keeping the attention of a group of tenth  graders on a Sunday morning was not easy, not to mention trying to teach them  something from the Bible! This caused me to pray very much for both the tenth  graders and myself, and helped me learn how to care for my younger brothers and  sisters. I also had many times of fellowship with the others caring for the  tenth graders, and we eventually built up a sweet relationship through our  prayer and coordination together.<br />
              <br />
            <strong>S</strong>pending time with Christians from the  church in New York City changed me a great deal, at least as much as my  education there did. Looking back on my college years, I can now say that being  with the brothers and sisters in the church in New York has caused me to love  the Lord even more and to consecrate myself to Him.</p>
