          Deeper Experiences of Christ<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2">My first  contact with the church in Portland was in 1972. At that time my wife, Sandi,  and I were living in Coos Bay on Oregon's southern coast. In our pursuit of  deeper experiences of Christ, under God's&nbsp;sovereignty, we were brought  into contact with the&nbsp;local churches at conferences held in San Francisco,  Sacramento, Seattle and Spokane. During those times of gatherings we met a few  families who were&nbsp;meeting as the church in Portland, Oregon. Among the  families&nbsp;we met from&nbsp;Portland, we became close&nbsp;to Dan &amp;  Dorothy Leslie, Ray and Jan Desimone, Dave and Pam Lewis, Roth Williams and  Gene Ford. Since Portland was closer to us than any of the other localities we  had visited, we made several trips to Portland on weekend visits during 1972  and 1973. On three occasions a few families from Portland also visited us in  Coos Bay. Those times were very shepherding to my wife and I. Our remembrances  of the times we spent with the brothers and sisters in Portland are precious to  us.</p>
            <p class="style2">In 1973,  Sandi and I moved to Los Angeles to sit at the feet and under the direct  ministry of brother Witness Lee. We met for years in southern California,  mostly in Anaheim. What a treasure to have had&nbsp;such an&nbsp;opportunity.  Those years formed the foundation of our&nbsp;life. Then, in the summer of  1980, for the Lord's move and for the&nbsp;spread of His expression, my wife,  our three children and&nbsp;I moved to Portland, Oregon. We have lived and  served in the church life in Portland now for over 28 years. Since our move, we  have observed the brothers and sisters&nbsp;growing day by day, year after year  in the divine life, and in caring for His enlargement and expression. Our  service, especially the past 15 years, has been&nbsp;among the college age  young people. Currently, we are cooperating with the Lord to field a full time  campus team here to serve primarily at Portland State University. We are  enjoying meeting in God's ordained way; bringing the divine life to unbelievers  and shepherding one another&nbsp;for the building up of the church life. By  meeting in the homes of the saints in this way,&nbsp;we are being vitalized  into&nbsp;our full function. We treasure this opportunity to labor together  with one heart and in one spirit for the furtherance of the gospel. May the  Lord continue to grow in the saints here in Portland&nbsp;for the building up  of His Body, the church.</p>
