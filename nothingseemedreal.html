          Nothing Seemed Real to Me<br />
          </p>
            <p class="style2"><strong>T</strong>o recall my initial touch with the Lord would take me back to January  1970. I was a 17-year-old student in St. Louis, Missouri, daily wandering  through high school aimlessly. Nothing seemed real to me. Everything around me  was based on outward and superficial sources. In my heart, I felt lost and  lonely; “a square peg in a round hole.” One day as I was heading for class I  heard a noisy commotion coming from the other end of the hallway. Two girls  were walking down the hall saying, “Praise the Lord,” and “Jesus is Lord.”  Their faces were shining. They had a glow of happiness! Some students were  saying that they were on drugs. Others said they were in the “hippie” movement.  I determined to find out the real story from them. At the end of the day I saw  them walking toward their car. They were singing and praising the Lord with no  self-consciousness. I stopped them and asked them, “What happened to you?” They  told me they had just returned from a Christian conference in California given  by Witness Lee and that they had been saved. Being a young Catholic girl, I was  unfamiliar with the term “saved.” They asked me if I would like to be saved.  “Saved from what?” I responded. They said, “Saved from everything! Saved from  eternal death, saved from sin, saved from misery, saved from yourself.” They  were bubbling over with joy. I told them, “I talk to God in the heavens all the  time but I am not as happy as you seem to be.” They took out their Bibles and  read to me Romans 10:9-13. “That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord  and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be  saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the  mouth there is confession unto salvation. For the Scripture says, `Everyone who  believes on Him shall not be put to shame.' For there is no distinction between  Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon  Him; For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” They  encouraged me to call on the Lord's name with them.
